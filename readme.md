## AoC 2022

This repo stores my inputs and solutions for advent of code, an annual puzzle challenge.

I'm doing this for fun and to brush up my scripting - don't expect any crazy code golf or esoteric tooling. I'm using basic b Python (with type hints) and I'm just trying to solve the problems as they come. I usually pop open the website on my lunch break, slap together a quick and dirty solve, and call it done.

The structure of these files is as follows:
- My scripts are labeled solution[x].py, where 'x' is the day from 1-25
- Hyperlinks to the problem descriptions are in the header of each Python script
- Puzzle inputs are stored in text files, labeled input[x].txt
- Supplemental or test input values are sometimes provided, in which case they'll be in input[x]a.txt, input[x]b.txt, etc.
- Scripts are commented with explanations, and retrospective thoughts after each solve

I'll try to keep track of if I fail to complete any puzzles, or drop out of the challenge. I might also come back later and finish any puzzles I miss during December. In the end, I'm not competing or even trying to show off scripting mastery. I'm only doing this for one person - me! If for some reason you're reading this and you're not me, you're welcome to check out my solutions, just know what you're getting yourself into.
